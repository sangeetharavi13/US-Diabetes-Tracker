## About Project 👨‍💻

The New Face ad agency is seeking a dashboard that can generate informative data on the gender, age, and ethnicity of individuals who were diagnosed with diabetes in various US states from 2010 to 2020. 

This Dashboard will help the ad agency gain valuable insights into the demographics and trends of diabetes diagnosis in different US states, and can inform their advertising and marketing strategies accordingly.
